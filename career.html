        <p>Kobe's entire career with with the Los Angeles Lakers. He was drafted by the Charlotte Hornets back in 1996 but was traded to LA that same day.
            He had enormous succes early on in his career by winning three championships in a row with Shaquille O'neal. This was the last time
            a three peat has been done in the NBA. Has not been done since. Almost a decade later, he found the missing piece in his pursuit of another
            championship goal when the Lakers aquired Pau Gasol. They went on to go to the NBA Finals three years straight between 2008 - 2010 and
            winning two of those rings. Kobe retired with 5 championships under his belt and ended his incredible 20 year career with the Lakes
            in April 2016.
